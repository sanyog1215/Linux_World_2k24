Menu-Driven Project: A Comprehensive Toolkit
Overview
This project is a capstone application that integrates key technologies from my curriculum into a versatile, menu-driven toolkit. Each menu option represents a distinct area of expertise, providing practical solutions and educational value.

Features
Frontend Development: Responsive UI with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.\n Python Programming: Automation scripts, API integration, and data manipulation. GenAIops: AI-driven DevOps to optimize workflows with generative AI. Docker: Containerized applications ensuring consistency across environments. Full Stack Development: Complete web application with frontend, backend (Node.js), and database (MongoDB, MySQL). Databases: CRUD operations and complex queries for SQL and NoSQL databases. Linux Operations: Shell scripting, system administration, and network management. AWS Services: Deployment, storage, and computing using EC2, S3, Lambda, and more.

Steps:
Launch AWS EC2 instance and allow necessary traffic. Install Apache: yum install httpd, then systemctl start httpd and systemctl enable httpd. Install Python and dependencies: yum install python3-pip, pip install twilio google-generativeai geopy paramiko boto3 requests beautifulsoup4 secure-smtplib. Install Docker: yum install docker, then systemctl start docker and systemctl enable docker. Dependencies Twilio: Communication via SMS and voice. Google Generative AI: Text and media generation. Geopy: Geographical data handling. Paramiko: Secure SSH connections. Boto3: AWS service management. Requests: HTTP requests and API interaction. BeautifulSoup4: HTML parsing and web scraping. Secure-SMTPlib: Secure email sending. This project showcases my ability to integrate and apply knowledge across multiple domains in software development and cloud computing.
